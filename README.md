# Linting Boilerplates

### Various boilerplates building from eslint-recommends
#### eslint-basic-boilerplate.json
#### eslint-csps.json

###### note: make sure to rename to ```.eslintrc.json``` when using these.

- ```root: true``` makes sure the no other eslintrc files are used.
- ```ignorePatterns``` ignoring test directories entirely.
- ```no-unused-vars``` turned off for top level functions only. Unused vars inside of functions will still be flagged.
